# Smooth-FIR-Deconvolution
Using the smooth Finite Impulse Response (sFIR) Deconvolution Technique on fMRI data to extract the Haemodynamic Response Function (HRF).
This was originally created to be used for Interictal Epileptiform Discharges (IEDs) and Generalized Spike Waves (GSWs), but can also be used for other intrinsic events.
